DS9:Redefined a project that revolves around Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager. The basic principle is this: These shows, beloved by millions, have been essentially abandoned in their current state by Paramount. After a technically successful, but expensive, remastering of Star Trek: The Next Generation from the original film elements, Paramount has thus far decided to forgo the same process with DS9 and VOY.

Now, there are plenty of shows that have remained in standard definition, and for many of those it's just fine. SD doesn't mean "bad," just as HD, UHD, 4K, 8K, etc. doesn't mean "good." DS9 and VOY do not fall into the "just fine" category, however, at least for DS9 seasons 1-3 and VOY seasons 1-4. The transfers for these seasons were digitized for DVD in the early 2000s, but it was done very poorly. The image quality is low-grade, lacking detail, dull colors, replete with rainbow moire artifacts, dot crawl, interlacing artifacts, and more. This is not what they looked like when they were broadcast, and no, it isn't the fact that we watched on CRT televisions (well, not entirely). How do we know this?

LaserDiscs. Thank God for LaserDiscs.

LaserDisc looks like a DVD the size of a vinyl record, but they are more akin to vinyl than to DVD. They contain RF analog video signals, like a VHS tape. However, the video data is recorded with a much higher frequency and bandwidth than VHS, giving them superior image quality. The transfers to LaserDisc were done in the mid-to-late 90s, most likely from the master tapes, or a close generation copy. Since those tapes, while encoded digitally, contained analog video data, the transfer is much closer to a 1:1 transfer, with no digitization getting in the way. In other word, what they contain is what was broadcast, or as close as we can get to it as public citizens who don't work for Paramount.

What happened with the DVDs? What we do know is that those earlier seasons were mastered on digital **composite** video tape formats. DS9 seasons 1-3 were mastered on D2. Voyager seasons 1-4 were also likely mastered on D2, but we aren't positive, and D3 was also a composite format available at the time. What is composite video? You can google elsewhere or find YouTube video thoroughly explaining composite and component video, so I'll spare you the technical details here except to say that composite video combines both brightness (luma) and color (chroma) data into a single signal. This saves a ton of signal bandwidth and therefore money. However, in order to decode this signal back into its luma and chroma components, it has to be passed through a comb filter that separates their signal bands from each other. If that comb filter is of poor quality or improperly calibrated, and if your signal chain isn't solid for some reason, you can get signal cross-contamination, which causes rainbows, checkerboarding, dot crawl, all the artifacts and quality issues we see on the DVDs. It also appears the luma signal has degraded somehow, perhaps by using a low-bandwidth composite video output of the tape machine. Perhaps they were given bad, farther generation copies as their source. We aren't sure. Then there's the color. On modern LCD-based TVs and monitors, the colors look dull, less saturated with skin tones shifted more brown and grays and whites tinted more green. This is likely due to everything being done with CRT monitors, which use an entirely different colorspace (BT.470m in the US) than LCDs (BT.601 in the US). Whatever happened, the early seasons DVDs look bad, with all those issues baked-in.

What about the later seasons? DS9 seasons 4-7 and VOY seasons 5-7 were mastered on DigiBetacam, a component video format. Since this was a component-to-component transfer when encoding the DVDs, we don't see an of the issues that we see with earlier seasons. In this case the DVDs are actually better, as LaserDisc is a composite video format.

This project formed a small team to acquire as many LaserDiscs as was reasonable (or unreasonable sometimes), capture them to digital files using the DomesDay Duplicator in order to retain every bit of video quality present on the discs, and decode and stack multiple copies using the ld-decode suite of tools. Besides providing a high-quality source for our own restoration and upscaling projects, we also want to preserve the data on these discs for posterity. LaserDiscs don't last forever, and depending on where they were manufactured, some have already degraded enough to be unuseable. Fortunately, the discs for these series were well-made, and almost all of them that we have acquired are still in great condition.

For restoration and upscaling, I (and others) are using many different tools, some of which use markup scripts and complicated command line strings. The process is constantly growing and changing, and that brings me to this repository. On a suggestion from Reddit, I've decided to learn to use Github in order to document and track this process instead of keeping stuff in scattered text files on various hard drives. I'll be learning as I go on how the best way to do this is, so be patient with me and feel free to make suggestions, and also feel free to use these scripts for your own projects.
